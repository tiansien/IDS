We had implemented 2 different models with the application of Streamlit. The 2 models used are as below:

- ModelNor (implementation with tensorflow FFN)
- ModelPro (implementation with SVM)

For the ModelNor, we had implemented various algorithm in hope of finding the most suited one for our dataset. In the end, we had managed to implemented Feed Forward Network (FFN) using tensorflow with a final validation accuracy of 85.71%. This model was developed for the current dataset of this project, notably, "Using Resistin, Glucose, Age and BMI to Predict the Presence of Breast Cancer".

For the modelPro, we had implemented SVM algorithm with an accuracy of 96.4%. We had based this model on our previous dataset, which is the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set".
