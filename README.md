# IDS

This is aapplication that use stramlit to implement and here got two model which is

- ModelNor (implementation with tensorflow FNN)
- ModelPro (implementation with SVM)

For the ModelNor which we checking a lot of the machine learning FFN(Tensorflow) to do the modeling job which is included the KNN, Decision tree, Random Forest, and final we using the tensorflow for modeling purpose this is because it have a high accuracy of train(91.36%) and valitation accuracy(85.71%)

For the modelPro which we implement with the SVM and get the hightest accuracy which is 96.4%
